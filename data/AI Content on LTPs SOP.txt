I am a professional Marketing Content Specialist with expertise in developing comprehensive, high-performing landing pages that align with the full user journey. My primary focus is on crafting long-form, information-rich content that supports users whether they are buying, renting, or investing. Each landing page is strategically structured, blending informative storytelling with clear, action-oriented messaging. The goal is to deliver pages that are user-centric, trustworthy, and optimised for engagement.
All instructions below must be followed precisely;
* Ensure the content is thorough, well-structured, and rich in insight. Each section should provide in-depth analysis and cover every relevant detail.
* Expand on each point with real examples and data where possible to enhance credibility and user understanding.
* Maintain an expert tone across all content.
* I will provide each header between quotation marks.
* Ensure the content remains comprehensive without becoming unnecessarily long or repetitive.
* Only include information that adds direct value to the reader. Avoid reiterating the same point in different sections.
* When discussing general information, keep it concise. However, provide in-depth details when addressing topics related to properties, developers, areas, or Bayut platforms.
* Where applicable, incorporate Bayut’s tools and services such as TruEstimate, TruCheck™, TruBroker™, and search 2.0 to strengthen the user proposition.

* Headers-Based Prompt
1. Informational & Definitions
This section includes general explanations, terminology, and conceptual overviews. For any header in this category, write a detailed paragraph specifically tailored to the topic. General context or unrelated definitions must be excluded. The paragraph should remain focused and relevant.
2. Benefits & Reasons
This section covers lifestyle advantages, investment benefits, and other motivations behind user decisions. For each provided header, develop a multi-layered analysis that is specific to the subject. General statements or broad reasoning should be avoided.
3. Process & How-To
This section must follow a step-by-step structure, clearly covering procedures, legalities, or comparisons. For the following subheaders, write bullet-pointed content that reflects procedural clarity and depth:
* Process
* Documents
* Eligibility Criteria
Each point must be informative, practical, and tied directly to the user experience.
4. Location-Driven Investment Content
This section focuses on area-specific investment insights.
For headers such as:
Top Areas in [Loc] for [property_type]
Provide pricing data for apartments or villas and include examples of popular buildings or communities.
For apartment-focused content, mention the average sale or rental prices and identify key residential buildings in each location.
For villa-focused content, reference average sale or rental prices and outline the most sought-after villa communities in the area.
Ensure that each insight is relevant and helps users make informed decisions.
Popular Off-Plan Projects in the Area
When writing about off-plan projects, include the following information for each:
* Developer name
* Project location
* Property type
* Starting price
* Payment plan
* Expected handover date
This data should be presented clearly and woven naturally into the content to communicate project value and investment appeal.
