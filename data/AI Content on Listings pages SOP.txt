The objective of this SOP is to establish clear and structured guidelines for the creation and management of AI-generated content designed to enhance Listings Pages on Bayut, including Listings Page Views (LPVs) and Long Tale Pages (LTPs).
Purpose:

Full Content Creation Process
Step 1: Understand Headers Structure
Before writing any content:
1.1 Review Headers
   * Open the page brief or headers file/ sheet provided.
   * Study every main header and subheader carefully.

For LPVs:
      * Differentiate between Ready LPVs, New Projects LPVs and Projects Pages.
      * Recognize differences across LOC1, LOC2, LOC3, LOC4 headers structure.

For LTPs:
         * Understand headers grouping:
         * Informational/Definitions
         * Benefits/Reasons
         * Process/How-To
         * Location-Specific Investment Content

1.2 Identify Content Flow and Focus
            * Define the primary page purpose:

               * Is it to explain an area, a property or an off plan project?
               * Showcase investment opportunities?
               * Guide a buyer through a process?

                  * Note if the focus is lifestyle, affordability, luxury, or investment-driven.

1.3 Study SEO/Keyword Intent
                     * Understand which keywords are being targeted.
                     * Confirm what the reader expects to find on the page.

🔵 Critical Rule: You cannot begin writing until you fully understand the page structure, headers, and objective.
Step 2: Apply the Correct AI Prompt
Once you understand the page’s structure and focus:
2.1 Choose the Right Prompt






For
	Use
	Ready LPVs
	

Use the relevant LOC2 / LOC3 / LOC4 prompt.


	

New Projects LPVs




	                        * Use the New Projects LPV prompt.
                        * Use the Project Pages Prompt.




	Long Tale Pages (LTPs)
	Use the Long Tail Pages prompt provided 




	


🔵 Critical Rule: AI output is just a starting point. It must be reviewed, validated, and refined before use.
Step 3: Customize and Optimize the Content
After you have the AI draft:
3.1 Realign with the Page Header Structure
                        * Organize the output exactly according to the provided headers.
                        * No section should be missing or misplaced.
                        * Avoid additional, irrelevant content that is not aligned with headers.

3.2 Tailor Examples, Data, and Insights
                           * Add real-world examples specific to the location, project, or property type.
                           * For area insights, provide examples of:
                           * Key communities
                           * Popular projects
                           * Price ranges (with correct per year/month clarification when needed).

                              * For off-plan projects, always include:
                              * Developer name
                              * Location
                              * Property type
                              * Starting price (AED format)
                              * Payment plan details
                              * Expected handover date

3.3 Validate All Factual Data
Cross-check all information against:
                                 * Bayut’s Data System
                                 * New Projects Section
                                 * Official Developer Websites
                                 * Trusted Public Releases
                                 * Project’s Brochure

Note: Prices, payment plans, handover dates, and developer names must be 100% accurate.
3.4 Run the Prompt
                                    * Input the base prompt into your AI tool.
                                    * Ensure the AI output generates the full structure, matching the required headers.
                                    * Verify that essential sections like project details, area insights, process steps, or investment data are present.
3.5 Adjust Tone, Depth, and Style
                                    * Maintain a professional, expert tone.
                                    * Avoid unnecessary repetition.
                                    * Ensure the text flows naturally and logically between sections.

Final Key Reminder
"Understand → Apply → Customize"
Only after understanding the landing page structure should you run the prompt, and only after generating the first draft should you adapt it to match the user journey, structure, and Bayut’s brand voice."
🔵 Do not generate blindly. Do not submit without full alignment.
 🔵 Think like the user, write like the expert.
