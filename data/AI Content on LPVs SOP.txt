Content Guidelines:
Item
	Details & Examples
	Data Sourcing
	All factual details (e.g. prices, handover dates, payment plans) must be validated using:
– Bayut’s New Projects section
– Official developer websites
– Press releases / verified marketing material
	Price Format
	Always mention prices as:
✅ AED 1.2M
✅ AED 850K
❌ AED 1,200,000 or 850,000 AED
	Project Snapshot
	Every LPV project must include:
– Developer Name
– Project Location
– Property Type (apartments, villas, etc.)
– Starting Price
– Payment Plan
– Estimated Handover Date
	Structure
	Begin with a short intro (2–3 lines) followed by bullet-point data (snapshot), then flow into longer description paragraphs. Each feature (location, amenities, payment plan, etc.) should have a dedicated paragraph.
	Internal Linking
	Always include hyperlinks to:
– Project’s parent location (e.g. Apartments for sale in Downtown Dubai)
– Developer LPV if available
– TruEstimate™, TruCheck™, TruBroker™ tools and product pages
	Tone & Style
	Clear, professional, and informative. Avoid salesy tone. Write for informed buyers and investors. Use British English. Include keywords naturally for SEO.
	Developer Section
	Include a short branded paragraph about the developer’s reputation, past projects, and position in the market. Ensure the paragraph is unique to the LPV.

Prompt Instructions:
General Prompt (for all pages):
I am a professional Marketing Content Specialist with expertise in high-conversion, user-focused property content. My aim is to present each project on Bayut’s LPVs with clarity, depth, and SEO optimisation. I will incorporate verified data and real value propositions to help users make informed decisions about off-plan property purchases in the UAE.
Execution Rules:
   * Expand on each element of the project (location, views, amenities, pricing, developer) in a fluid, connected way.

   * Vary structure to avoid repetition—do not always place data in the same position.

   * Include examples where applicable (e.g. "a 1-bedroom apartment starting at AED 1.1M").

   * Always integrate Bayut tools and services where appropriate.
